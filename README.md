# Front_End_Finology_by_Siti_Norilly_Suhaily

## Overview
This project is a **responsive, user-friendly React.js application** that fetches and displays user data from the public API:

It demonstrates:
- API integration and error handling  
- Real-time search and filtering  
- Clean state management with React Hooks  
- Accessibility and responsive design  
- TypeScript implementation for maintainability and clarity

## Features

### API Integration
- Fetches and displays user data (name, email, city, company, phone, website)
- Gracefully handles **loading** and **error** states
- Artificial **3-second delay** added for testing ‚ÄúLoading‚Ä¶‚Äù state visibility

### Filtering System
- **Real-time search** by name
- **Filter by city** and **company** using dropdowns
- **Clear all filters** button to reset search and dropdowns
- Filters apply **AND logic** (all active filters must match)

### UI/UX & Accessibility
- Always shows:  
  `Showing X of Y users`
- Displays:
  `‚è≥ Loading‚Ä¶` during data fetch  
- Displays `‚ÑπÔ∏è No results found`  only when filters hide all users after loading  
- Accessible with proper **ARIA labels** and **screen-reader support**  
- Responsive layout designed for desktop and mobile
